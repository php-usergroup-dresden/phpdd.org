            Once a Web Developer, Jenny now works as a Community Engineer at Human Made. When she started, she spent 
            her first two weeks organizing a conference. She can often be found evangelizing open source community, 
            event organiser and occasionally, speaker.
        </p><p>    
            Her days are varied: From solving issues with event sites & supporting organisers, 
            to passionately cheering people on to contribute back to their communities. She loves 
            cooking up elaborate ideas to help improve participation experiences in open source projects.
        </p><p>    
            When away from the laptop, sheâ€™s usually binge watching Formula 1 & anime, doing house 
            renovations or making a mess whilst cooking. You can find her on your messaging 
            service of choice, making plenty of typos.
