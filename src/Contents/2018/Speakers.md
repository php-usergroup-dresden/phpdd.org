            Once a Web Developer, Jenny now works as a Community Engineer at Human Made. When she started, she spent 
            her first two weeks organizing a conference. She can often be found evangelizing open source community, 
            event organiser and occasionally, speaker.
        </p><p>    
            Her days are varied: From solving issues with event sites & supporting organisers, 
            to passionately cheering people on to contribute back to their communities. She loves 
            cooking up elaborate ideas to help improve participation experiences in open source projects.
        </p><p>    
            When away from the laptop, she’s usually binge watching Formula 1 & anime, doing house 
            renovations or making a mess whilst cooking. You can find her on your messaging 
            service of choice, making plenty of typos.

        <p>
           Mark is Lead/Senior Developer at Paybreak, a fintech company based in Altrincham near Manchester, UK.
        </p><p>   
           He has worked in the computer software industry since before symbolics.com was registered as a domain name, before "cyberspace" was first mentioned in fiction, when Linus Torvalds and Rasmus Lerdorf were still at high school, and Mrs. Zuckerberg had yet to give birth to a bouncing baby social network enabler; and has developed for the Web in many different languages since the days when the Tim Berners-Lee's creation comprised less than 1,000 sites.
        </p><p>  
           Over those years he has contributed to a number of open source projects: including a minor submission to PHP's SPL. Currently he is coordinator and lead developer for the PHPExcel library, and a coordinator and developer on the PHPOffice library suite. Most recently, he has been working on new datastructures such as Tries, Quadtrees and Matrices; hoping that he'll eventually be able to get them included in SPL.
        </p><p>   
           His particular interests include PHP integration with office suites, Generators, Textual analysis, Geodata and geographic information systems, and "big data" and data analysis.
