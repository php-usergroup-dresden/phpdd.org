            Once a Web Developer, Jenny now works as a Community Engineer at Human Made. When she started, she spent 
            her first two weeks organizing a conference. She can often be found evangelizing open source community, 
            event organiser and occasionally, speaker.
        </p><p>    
            Her days are varied: From solving issues with event sites & supporting organisers, 
            to passionately cheering people on to contribute back to their communities. She loves 
            cooking up elaborate ideas to help improve participation experiences in open source projects.
        </p><p>    
            When away from the laptop, sheâ€™s usually binge watching Formula 1 & anime, doing house 
            renovations or making a mess whilst cooking. You can find her on your messaging 
            service of choice, making plenty of typos.

        <p>
           Mark is Lead/Senior Developer at Paybreak, a fintech company based in Altrincham near Manchester, UK.
        </p><p>   
           He has worked in the computer software industry since before symbolics.com was registered as a domain name, before "cyberspace" was first mentioned in fiction, when Linus Torvalds and Rasmus Lerdorf were still at high school, and Mrs. Zuckerberg had yet to give birth to a bouncing baby social network enabler; and has developed for the Web in many different languages since the days when the Tim Berners-Lee's creation comprised less than 1,000 sites.
        </p><p>  
           Over those years he has contributed to a number of open source projects: including a minor submission to PHP's SPL. Currently he is coordinator and lead developer for the PHPExcel library, and a coordinator and developer on the PHPOffice library suite. Most recently, he has been working on new datastructures such as Tries, Quadtrees and Matrices; hoping that he'll eventually be able to get them included in SPL.
        </p><p>   
           His particular interests include PHP integration with office suites, Generators, Textual analysis, Geodata and geographic information systems, and "big data" and data analysis.

           A graduated Computer Engineer, Rafael Dohms has vast experience in the PHP ecosystem as a Developer, Speaker and Contributor. Addicted in building communities he has founded various groups where ever he lives, currently he is to blame for AmsterdamPHP. Developer by career but teacher by vocation he travels the world sharing interest in quality code, innovation and building careers. In his free time you will likely find him gaming or contributing to open source projects.
        </p><p> 
           His contribution hit list includes many projects, from PHP itself to frameworks like Symfony, Zend and projects such as Doctrine and Composer. His hobby is mentoring new Speakers that eventually take speaking slots away from him in future events, a strategy he still thinks is not very smart. Not one to listen to himself he keeps mentoring and suggesting developers everywhere create their own User Groups to grow their networks and knowledge.
