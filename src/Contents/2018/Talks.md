## Does the SPL still have any relevance in the Brave New World of PHP7?

By [Mark Baker](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#mark-baker)

Largely ignored under PHP5, the SPL (Standard PHP Library) offered a powerful toolbox for developers, ranging from it's horrendously named collection of Iterators, and a series of Interfaces allowing us to build our own, to DataStructures, and Object Oriented file handling classes. Fast and powerful, the SPL provided a stable and well-tested library of classes and functions. But with all the performance and memory improvements of PHP7, SPL has remained unchanged, and feels like it has been left behind. Now, Generators provide a simpler replacement for writing our own Iterators without all the boilerplate code that SPL's core Iterators require, especially with the introduction of "yield from" in PHP7 for recursive Iterators.

And PHP7's performance improvements allow us to write our own Datastructures (based around standard PHP arrays, or custom objects) that are as efficient as SPL's basic Datastructures.

So does SPL still have any purpose or value in this new world of PHP7? Let's find out!

## Getting started with Kubernetes

By [Bastian Hofmann](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#bastian-hofmann)

Kubernetes is a very powerful container orchestration platform that is quickly gaining traction and gives you lots of 
benefits in deploying, running and scaling your microservice web application. But it has also a steep learning curve. 

In this talk I will introduce you to Kubernetes, why you would want to use it and all the tooling around Kubernetes 
with the help of practical examples.
