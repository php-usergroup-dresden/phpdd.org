## Does the SPL still have any relevance in the Brave New World of PHP7?

---
By [Mark Baker](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#mark-baker)

Largely ignored under PHP5, the SPL (Standard PHP Library) offered a powerful toolbox for developers, ranging from it's horrendously named collection of Iterators, and a series of Interfaces allowing us to build our own, to DataStructures, and Object Oriented file handling classes. Fast and powerful, the SPL provided a stable and well-tested library of classes and functions. But with all the performance and memory improvements of PHP7, SPL has remained unchanged, and feels like it has been left behind. Now, Generators provide a simpler replacement for writing our own Iterators without all the boilerplate code that SPL's core Iterators require, especially with the introduction of "yield from" in PHP7 for recursive Iterators.

And PHP7's performance improvements allow us to write our own Datastructures (based around standard PHP arrays, or custom objects) that are as efficient as SPL's basic Datastructures.

So does SPL still have any purpose or value in this new world of PHP7? Let's find out!

## Getting started with Kubernetes

---

By [Bastian Hofmann](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#bastian-hofmann)

Kubernetes is a very powerful container orchestration platform that is quickly gaining traction and gives you lots of 
benefits in deploying, running and scaling your microservice web application. But it has also a steep learning curve. 

In this talk I will introduce you to Kubernetes, why you would want to use it and all the tooling around Kubernetes 
with the help of practical examples.

## Zero Downtime Database Migrations and Deployments

---

By [OndÅ™ej Mirtes](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#ondrej-mirtes)

To survive in a competitive market, a software team must be able to deploy new versions of their application as frequently as possible, delivering new features, improvements and bugfixes for their users and stakeholders. Deployments should not be limited to a certain time or to a certain number, otherwise they become a bottleneck for the development process.

To avoid disruptions when frequently deploying new versions, developers must adopt a set of practices and workflows that allow changing the database schema in production without users even noticing. As a result, the development process becomes much more safe and smooth.

I will also talk about zero downtime deployments. They are less about development practices and more about deployment automation and webserver configuration. Some tips might even make your application perform faster!

## Climbing the Abstract Syntax Tree

---

By [James Titcumb](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#james-titcumb)

The new Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) in PHP 7 means the way our PHP code is being executed has changed. Understanding this new fundamental compilation step is key to understanding how our code is being run.

To demonstrate, James will show how a basic compiler works and how introducing an AST simplifies this process. Weâ€™ll look into how these magical time-warp techniques* can also be used in your code to introspect, analyse and modify code in a way that was never possible before.

After seeing this talk, you'll have a great insight as to the wonders of an AST, and how it can be applied to both compilers and userland code.

(*actual magic or time-warp not guaranteed)

## Large-scale website performance optimisation tricks

---

By [Georgiana Gligor](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#georgiana-gligor)

Practical lessons learned while revamping a US airline website to resist huge Black Friday and Cyber Monday traffic values. Using HTTP status codes and PHP cleverly, we have made parallel requests possible, so that the user experience is greatly enhanced, and we pre-cache resource-consuming user searches. All on a solid PHP foundation.

## Application metrics with prometheus

---

By [Rafael Dohms](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#rafael-dohms)

We all know not to poke at alien life forms in another planet, right? But what about metrics, do you know how to pick, measure and draw conclusions from them? In this talk we will cover Service Level Indicators (SLI), Objectives (SLO), and how to use Prometheus, an open-source system monitoring and alert platform, to measure and make sense of them. Let's get back to some real science.

## Mutation testing: better code by making bugs

---

By [ThÃ©o Fidry](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#theo-fidry)

Mutation testing: better code by making bugs Do you test your code? What about your tests? Your tests are code, you need to write, refactor and maintain them. This is not cheap so how do you make sure you are testing enough but not too much? Discover Mutation Testing, a fun tool to make your code better by introducing bugs.

<a name="profiling-php-applications"></a>
## Profiling PHP Applications

---

By [Ike Devolder](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#ike-devolder)

Help my client is complaining some parts of the application are slow. Now what?

Profiling!

What is profiling and how can we measure the performance of our application? There are several tools we can use. Once we have the tools, how do we approach profiling. What to look for. And caveats to avoid when profiling. To finish up, we should avoid that our client is complaining about performance, how can we pro actively use profiling to improve our application.

When finished we will end up with a nice toolbox of profiling tools and good ideas how to do profiling and avoid some common mistakes that might distract you from the real opimisation.

<a name="asynchronous-request-processing"></a>
## Asynchronous Request Processing

---

By [Jan Gregor Emge-Triebel](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#jan-gregor-emge-triebel)

Modern web applications or apis often handle heavy load tasks, requiring intense disk i/o or complex database queries. 
I will demonstrate how and - more importantly - why such operations should be processed asynchronously. 
We will be comparing a few messaging/queuing libraries and cover some of the most common pitfalls and obstacles 
developers face when implementing asynchronous processing and face long running php processes for the first time.

<a name="how-to-handle-shit"></a>
## How to handle ðŸ’©

---

By [Andreas Heigl](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#andreas-heigl)

You've got strange characters like "ï¿½" or "ÃƒÂ¶" display in your application? Yes, handling non-English characters in application code, 
files and databases can be a challenge, to say the least. Whether that's German Umlauts, Cyrillic letters, Asian Glyphs or Emojis: 
It's always a mess in an international application. In this session you will see why that is and how handling characters 
evolved in computing. You will also see how handling characters in applications and databases can be done less painfully. 
And don't worry when EBCDIC, BOM or ISO-8859-7 are Greek to you and your Unicode is a bit rusty: we'll have a look at them too!
