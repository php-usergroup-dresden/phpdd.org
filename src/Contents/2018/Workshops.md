## PRAGMATIC EVENT SOURCING

By [Arne Blankerts](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#arne-blankerts) and 
[Sebastian Heuer](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#sebastian-heuer)

> Domain-Driven Design, CQRS and Event Sourcing. Big words that obviously require an equally big tech stack to be applied - with bleeding edge frameworks, lots of tools, and a complex infrastructure to run it all. Or not?
> 
> In this workshop, we will create a solid, event-sourced web application from scratch. We will not rely on any framework or libraries to really get to the bottom of things.
> 
> Make sure to bring your laptop!
