## PRAGMATIC TDD

By [Luka Muzinic](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#luka-muzinic)

> Developers still hesitate to include writing tests in their everyday routine. There are numerous excuses, myths and misconceptions around: “they slow us down”, “we’ll never achieve 100% code coverage, so why bother”, “takes too much time to learn testing, we’re better of writing business logic instead”. When we get to the topic of writing tests first, the debate becomes even more heated.
>
> In real world, where you get paid by code that ships, developer strive to write the most efficient tests possible. To cover mission critical code. To quickly decide whether writing a functional test or series of unit tests is the best approach. Let us learn together how to use phpunit and TDD in most efficient way possible, for extraordinary results.
>
> This workshop is for developers who start their projects by drawing model of the database first, developers who are overwhelmed by number of testing tools or don’t know where to start and developers who simply want to level up their game.

[Sebastian Heuer](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#sebastian-heuer)

> Domain-Driven Design, CQRS and Event Sourcing. Big words that obviously require an equally big tech stack to be applied - with bleeding edge frameworks, lots of tools, and a complex infrastructure to run it all. Or not?
> 
> In this workshop, we will create a solid, event-sourced web application from scratch. We will not rely on any framework or libraries to really get to the bottom of things.
> 
> Make sure to bring your laptop!
