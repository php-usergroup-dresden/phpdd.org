Developers still hesitate to include writing tests in their everyday routine. There are numerous excuses, myths and misconceptions around: “they slow us down”, “we’ll never achieve 100% code coverage, so why bother”, “takes too much time to learn testing, we’re better of writing business logic instead”. When we get to the topic of writing tests first, the debate becomes even more heated.

In real world, where you get paid by code that ships, developer strive to write the most efficient tests possible. To cover mission critical code. To quickly decide whether writing a functional test or series of unit tests is the best approach. Let us learn together how to use phpunit and TDD in most efficient way possible, for extraordinary results.

This workshop is for developers who start their projects by drawing model of the database first, developers who are overwhelmed by number of testing tools or don’t know where to start and developers who simply want to level up their game.

## PRAGMATIC EVENT SOURCING <span class="small text-muted">- FULL-DAY WORKSHOP</span>

[Sebastian Heuer](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#sebastian-heuer)

Domain-Driven Design, CQRS and Event Sourcing. Big words that obviously require an equally big tech stack to be applied - with bleeding edge frameworks, lots of tools, and a complex infrastructure to run it all. Or not?

In this workshop, we will create a solid, event-sourced web application from scratch. We will not rely on any framework or libraries to really get to the bottom of things.
 
Make sure to bring your laptop!

## HACK THIS WORKSHOP! <span class="small text-muted">- HALF-DAY WORKSHOP</span>

---

By [Christopher Riley](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#christopher-riley)

In this workshop we will take a look at common security failings from a new perspective: that of the hacker. You'll be provided with a set of different sites each exhibiting a different security flaw, the challenge will be to find and exploit it and in doing so learn how to protect your own sites.
 
All the sites will be run locally inside docker containers so don't worry about breaking any laws! Obviously this means that you will need to bring a laptop which is capable of running docker containers in order to participate in this workshop.

## PENTESTING DO's & DONT's <span class="small text-muted">- HALF-DAY WORKSHOP</span>

---

By [Clinton Ingrams](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#clinton-ingrams)

This workshop is a necessarily short introduction to the work of a pentester. 
We will consider ethical issues, legal requirements, learning environments, tools used, and then we will explore the basics of an actual pentest. We will reference the OWASP Top 10, but we will also look at the contents of a scoping document, and how to structure a pentest by selecting relevant ideas from a range of pentesting methodologies.

## EVENT STORMING FOR FUN AND PROFIT! <span class="small text-muted">- HALF-DAY WORKSHOP</span>

---

By [Jeroen van der Gulik](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#jeroen-van-der-gulik)

One of the challenges we face on a day-to-day basis is getting the right and correct information from our product owners or clients. 
This can be both frustrating and decremental to the velocity of your team. No one likes to work on features that when delivered someone says "well... that wasn't exactly what I had in mind" But now we have Stickies! So many stickies! It's a whirlpool of stickies, what is this madness? In this interactive workshop, we will explore all the facets of Event Storming as a modelling technique to get a clear and precise mental model of how a feature is supposed to work, all using the power of stickies! As we go through the user story, we'll explain the different types of stickies, why they matter, and show why EventStorming is such an effective format.

## YOUR APP LIVES ON A NETWORK - NETWORKING FOR PHP DEVS <span class="small text-muted">- HALF-DAY WORKSHOP</span>

By [Wim Godden](@baseUrl@/speakers.html#wim-godden)

As PHP developers, our job is to build web applications. But how can we build applications that rely 
on networking if we don't know how these networks and the big network that connects them all (this thing called the Internet) 
actually work? In this tutorial, we walk through the basics of networking, before diving into all the essentials 
every PHP developer should know, from TCP/UDP over IP addressing (IPv4/6), source/destination ports, sockets, DNS, 
switching, firewalling and even more advanced protocols such as OSPF, VRRP and BGP. Prepare for an eye-opener when 
you realize how much a typical app relies on all of these (and many more) working flawlessly... and how you can prepare your app for failure in the chain.
