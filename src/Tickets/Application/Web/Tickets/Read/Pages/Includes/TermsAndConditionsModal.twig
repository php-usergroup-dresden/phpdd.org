                <h5>1. Data correctness</h5>
                <p>
                    By purchasing tickets you confirm that all given data is reliable and mirror true facts.
                    In case of misrepresentation of facts, we reserve the right to decline access to the event,
                    decline cancelation and/or refunding.
                </p>
                <h5>2. Access to the event</h5>
                <p>
                    Each attendee gets an individual ticket for each workshop and/or the conference.
                    Attendees only get access to these activities after the appropriate tickets were exhibited to
                    the organizers at the venue. Tickets can be shown in digital or non-digital form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All our side events and catering (except WurstCon) at the venue are included in the ticket prices.
                </p>
                <h5>3. Delivery of tickets</h5>
                <p>
                    Tickets will be delivered as PDF files via email to the given address of the buyer.
                </p>
                <h5>4. Production & delivery of the ticket purchase invoice</h5>
                <p>
                    As a German small business we are not allowed to tag the VAT portion of prices
                    on the invoice. Within the EU the reverse charge regulation is applied
                    (see: https://www.vatglobal.com/reporting-obligations-vat-guides/the-reverse-charge-mechanism).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The invoice will be delivered as a PDF file via email to the given address of the buyer.
                </p>
                <h5>5. Cancelation & refunding</h5>
                <p>
                    Cancelation is possible until 3 weeks before the event (deadline: August 31, 2018).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In case of a cancelation before September 1, 2018 we will refund the invoiced amount excluding a
                    refund fee of max. &euro;25. The refund fee depends on the used payment method. We will charge the
                    lowest possible refund fee.
